Our team is planning to create a web application which will let users
control all the necessary parameters of an AV-installation in an
intuitive and easy-to-use User Interface.

The control of all the devices is done by one central web application.
This enables every teacher or student to use the AV-installation present
in the LIZ(Lern-und Informationszentrum) without having to acquire any
additional technical knowledge. The goal is to minimize the time wasted
before the presentation can be started. Which not only makes everything
more professional but also reduces the stress put on the presenters when
something doesn't work.

We are additionally developing Interfaces between the web application
and the other devices using a Raspberry Pi.
