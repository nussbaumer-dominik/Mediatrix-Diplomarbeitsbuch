Our team is planning to create a web application which will enable users to control all of the necessary parameters of an AV-installation in an intuitive and easy-to-use Interface.

All devices can be controlled using one central web application running on any smartphone, tablet or desktop. This enables every teacher or student to use the AV-installation present in the "LIZ"(Lern-und Informationszentrum) without having to acquire any additional technical knowledge. Furthermore configurations can be saved as presets. These are easily activated during a presentation with the click of a button. The goal is to minimize the time wasted before a presentation is even started. This not only makes the experience more seamless and professional but also reduces the stress put on the presenters when something doesnâ€™t go as planned.

Additionally we are developing Interfaces between the web application and the other devices using a Raspberry Pi mini computer.
