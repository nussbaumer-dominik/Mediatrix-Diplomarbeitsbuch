Our team is planning to create a web application which will let users control all the necessary parameters of an AV-installation in an intuitive and easy-to-use User Interface.

All devices can be controlled using on central web application. This enables every teacher or student to use the AV-installation present in the "LIZ"(Lern-und Informationszentrum) without having to acquire any additional technical knowledge. Furthermore presets can be saved. These enables you to easily activate them later during a presentation. The goal is to minimize the time wasted before a presentation can be started. This not only makes the experience more seamless and professional but also reduces the stress put on the presenters when something doesnâ€™t go as planned.

Additionally we are developing Interfaces between the web application and the other devices using a Raspberry Pi.
