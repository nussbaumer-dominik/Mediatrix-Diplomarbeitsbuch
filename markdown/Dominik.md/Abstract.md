Mediatrix is a web application which will enable users to control all of the necessary parameters of an AV-installation in an intuitive and easy-to-use Interface.

All devices can be controlled using one central web application running on any smartphone, tablet or desktop. This enables every user to use the AV-installation present in the "LIZ"(Lern-und Informationszentrum) without having to acquire any additional technical knowledge. Furthermore configurations can be saved as presets. These are easily activated during a presentation with the click of a button. The goal is to minimize the time wasted before a presentation is even started. This not only makes the experience more seamless and professional but also reduces the pressure put on the presenters when something does not go according to plan.

Additionally Interfaces between the web application and the other devices are implemented using a Raspberry Pi mini computer.
